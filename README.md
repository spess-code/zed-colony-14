Zed Colony 14 is a fork of Space Station 14 that takes place on a space colony in the middle of a zombie outbreak.

The design philosophy with this fork is to integrate roleplay and gameplay as close as possible. Even though this is a zombie outbreak survival simulator, the main server is medium roleplay, meaning that cooperation should be vital for progression.
