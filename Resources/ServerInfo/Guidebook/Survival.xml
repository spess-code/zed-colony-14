## Other Various Tips
- Lacking an actual health analyzer, simply examining yourself and using the detailed examine is a good way to figure out what wounds you have.
- If going blind, carrots are another way to treat the issue (as they contain Oculine, the chemistry drug used to treat blindness) should they be available.
- Well-made meals (cooked food not from a vending machine) is generally much better for your overall health and can help heal smaller wounds more quickly.
- Simple bed rest can allow some wounds to close up on their own. Medical beds are best for this, providing a sterile surface and support for all damaged body parts, but any bed works.
- Actually sleeping on a bed boosts your healing rate even farther.
- Meals that contain proteins, such as meat, - will tremendously help your body's condition after severe bloodloss. It's still advised to visit a doctor and get treated though.


## Treating Zombie Infection
If you were infected, here are the steps you can take:
  - Pray to your God of choice.
  - If you have weapons, it is recommended to take down as many zombies as you can with you.
  - When you feel like you are succumbing to the disease, end it on your own terms.
