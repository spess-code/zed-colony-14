Welcome to Zed Colony 14! You are a survivor on one of many colonies in space. In the last 24 hours, Cataclysm happened, which resulted in your planet being filled with zombies. However, there may be more dangers...

As a player, you are playing the role of your character: a survivor, be it a normal citizen, military soldier or a visitor from space. Your main goal is to survive, no matter the cost.

Please make sure you understand the server rules (F1) and if you have any questions, consult this guide, other survivors or in Discord. You can also ask admins for help (ahelp) by hitting the escape key > admin help and typing a message to any online admins. Especially do this if you witness someone breaking rules.

Instead of intents, we have combat mode. Check controls below for its keybind. You can't attack anybody with it off, so no more hitting yourself with your own crowbar.
